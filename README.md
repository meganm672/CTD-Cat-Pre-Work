# CTD-Cat-Pre-Work

I utilized the CatAPI to do my prework assignment. To use more of the API I made a basic server file because I wanted to hide my API Key to be secure. You will see in previous commits I used a key in the top of my `script.js` file to get the images to show but after I refactored I went back and got a new key so no one can mess with the api key. 

The 2 data models I used was random cat images being displayed on one page and a breed card being displayed on another page.
